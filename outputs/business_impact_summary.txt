===== Business Impact Summary =====
Assumptions:
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $50 per year
- Total Annual Users: 500000
- Target Subgroup Size (top 20% responders): 100,000 users

Full Rollout Loss (treatment hurts overall):
- 500,000 users × -29.27% lift × $50 ARPU
= $-7,317,500.00 per year (negative means revenue loss)

Targeted Subgroup Profit (using S-Learner top responders):
- 100,000 users × 37.11% lift × $50 ARPU
= +$1,855,643.93 per year

Net Savings by Targeting Subgroup Instead of Full Rollout:
= Targeted Gain - Full Rollout Loss = $9,173,143.93 per year

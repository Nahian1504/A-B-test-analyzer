A/B Test Results Summary

Summary:

This report summarizes the key findings of the A/B test designed to evaluate the impact of a new user treatment. The initial analysis showed that the new treatment had a negative effect on the overall user base, with an overall relative lift of -29.27%. However, by using advanced uplift modeling, we were able to identify a specific subgroup of users who respond positively to the treatment. Implementing a targeted approach for this subgroup is projected to generate significant net savings compared to a full-scale rollout.
Key Quantitative Metrics

The A/B test involved a total of more than 580,000 users.

    Overall Average Treatment Effect (ATE):

        Conversion Rate (Treatment): 0.0181

        Conversion Rate (Control): 0.0255

        ATE (Absolute Lift): -0.0075

        ATE (Relative Lift %): -29.27%

    Best-Performing Uplift Model: The S-Learner model was most effective at identifying users with a positive response to the treatment, achieving a relative uplift of 37.11% within the top-performing subgroup.

    Uplift Scores:

        uplift_t_learner: 0.0000

        uplift_s_learner: 0.7082

        uplift_x_learner: 0.5051


Uplift Models:

The following models were used to predict which users would respond positively to the treatment.

    T-Learner (Two-Model Approach): This is a straightforward method that trains two separate models: one for the treated group and one for the control group. It predicts the uplift by simply subtracting the predictions of the two models.

    S-Learner (Single-Model Approach): This approach trains a single model on all the data, with a special feature indicating whether a user was in the treated or control group. It's often simpler but can sometimes miss subtle interactions between the treatment and other user characteristics.

    X-Learner (Advanced Meta-Learner): This is a more sophisticated, two-stage model. It first predicts the outcomes for both the treated and control groups and then uses those predictions to train a second model specifically to estimate the uplift directly. This method often provides more accurate results, especially when the effect of the treatment is small.


Subgroup Analysis & Business Impact:

While the overall ATE was negative, a detailed analysis of the top 20% most responsive users (as identified by the S-Learner model) revealed a significant positive lift.

By targeting only this high-potential subgroup, we can transform a potential loss into a substantial gain.

Targeted Subgroup Profit: +$1,855,643.93 per year (Profit generated from the top 100,000 users in the subgroup who respond positively.)

Net Savings: $9,173,143.93 per year (The difference between the targeted profit and the revenue loss from a full rollout.)


Conclusion and Recommendations:

The results strongly suggest that a full rollout of the new treatment would be detrimental to revenue. However, a targeted campaign, powered by the S-Learner uplift model, is highly recommended. By delivering the treatment exclusively to the identified high-response subgroup, we can generate a positive return on investment and achieve a net savings of over $9.17 million per year compared to a full rollout.
